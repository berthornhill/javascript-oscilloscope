          <div class="bold-text">What is it?</div>
          <div>
            This program is a type of interactive oscilloscope.
            <span class="bold-text">
              An oscilloscope is a scientific instrument that displays a
              waveform from an electrical source, which can then be observed and
              analyzed visually.
            </span>
            This particular oscilloscope uses the
            <span class="bold-text"> JavaScript AudioContextAPI </span> to
            generate a periodic wave at a given pitch as an
            <span class="bold-text">OscillatorNode</span>.
          </div>
          <div>
            This
            <span class="bold-text"> pitch (Hz)</span> is then used to calculate
            and derive a very zoomed-in, visual representation of the wave which
            is rendered as an animation using the
            <span class="bold-text"> HTML5 CanvasAPI</span>. Each
            OscillatorNode‚Äôs <span class="bold-text"> frequency </span>, or
            <span class="bold-text"> pitch</span>, can be raised or lowered with
            the right most range-slider and can be read as the number of waves
            shown on screen at any time. Doubling the frequency of the wave will
            amount to twice as many waves on screen where as halving the
            frequency will have the opposite effect.

        <div class="text-bullet">
          <div class="bold-text">What do I do with it?</div>
          <div>
            Have fun! Explore the result of the wave form when moving the slider
            bar. Add more tone nodes and explore how they interact with each
            other, both audibly and visually. The results can be both beautiful
            and horrifying. See what happens when pitches are far apart vs when
            they are right next to each other? Can you make a consonant chord?
          </div>
          <div>
            <span class="bold-text"> Pro-tip: </span>
            The sliders can be adjusted with the keyboard's arrow-keys which can
            not only creates a smoother visual effect, allows for finer tuning
            of the pitches and can cause some really wild acoustic results.

        <div class="text-bullet">
          <div class="bold-text">What is an oscillator?</div>
          <div>
            An oscillator is a wave that repeatedly moves back and forth, or a
            wave that is oscillating. In the context of this application, the
            <span class="bold-text">OscillatorNode</span> creates an instance of
            an oscillator at a set frequency in the form of a sine wave and
            outputs a constant tone.
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="text-bullet">
          <div class="bold-text">What exactly is pitch?</div>
          <div>
            In musical application,
            <span class="bold-text">
              pitch describes the audible quality of a sound wave, relative to
              its frequency measured in Hz, or oscillations per second.
            </span>
            A sound with a higher frequency is described as ‚Äúhigher in pitch‚Äù
            than a sound with lower frequency. The human audible range is
            generally assumed to be frequencies from 20 Hz to 20,000Hz. This
            program is set to generate pitches that range from 20 Hz to 3000 Hz.
          </div>
          <div>
            Pitch can also be used to describe named frequencies which make up
            various scales, the primary organizing principle in music aside from
            rhythm. These namings can be quite regional and cultural but one
            relatively common example is the named note ‚ÄúA‚Äù which orchestras
            tune to is most commonly referring to the frequency 440 Hz, at least
            in North America. Hence the term ‚ÄúA 440‚Äù.

          <div>
            I am a full stack software engineer, musician, and educator. I have
            a love of computers, learning, music as well as for sharing my
            enthusiasm for these things with anyone who will listen.

            but I am always looking to learn more languages and grow as a
            developer. As a musician, I've performed and recorded all over the
            country and world but mostly around New York City. Feel free to
